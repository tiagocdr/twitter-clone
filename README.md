# Twitter Clone By Santiago Toro 



Welcome to my Twitter Clone Solo Project, this project is an MVP showcasing basic features of social media web development applications.
Fully developed using Python and Django as the framework, chosen to be developed this way to prepare and demonstrate for Django's easily scalable framework and how real life application giants such as instagram are also django based. 

Features included in this project include :
* Notifications: with the "@" prefix you can name any existing user and the mentioned user will receive a notification on his profile. 
* Login and SingUp 
* Database Authentication 
* User protected routes
* Post Submission into database
